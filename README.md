# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step 1:
We have imported numpy which is needed.

Step 2:
We have created a matrix by using np.array with different values in it.

Step 3:
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.

Step 4:
Finally, print the value of the rank of the matrix.
## Program:
```
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]])
b=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(b)

```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the rank for the given matrix is successfully solved by  using a python program.
